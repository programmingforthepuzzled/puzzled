# Programming for the Puzzled
Source for the website: https://programmingforthepuzzled.github.io/puzzled/
## Offline Usage
Download the repository and extract the "docs" folder. Open "index.html".
The website should work on any recent version of Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. It theoretically should also work in other browsers, such as Safari/Opera, but that hasn't been tested due to lack of access to the aforementioned browsers.

## Accessibility Usage
Use the [accessible version of the puzzle selection menu](https://programmingforthepuzzled.github.io/puzzled/index_a.html) in order to load puzzles with accessibility mode enabled.

In accessibility mode, the code editor will have some accessibility features enabled by default.

Also, the final state of each puzzle after execution of the user's code will be printed to the console in addition to the normal error, warning, or success messages.

The website uses the Monaco code editor, which has a variety of [accessibility features when editing code](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor/wiki/Monaco-Editor-Accessibility-Guide).

Press "function key + f1" or "alt + f1" or just "f1" and type "accessibility" in order to modify the Monaco editor's accessibility options.

Open "index_a.html" when using the project offline instead of "index.html". This opens the accessible version of the puzzle selection menu.
